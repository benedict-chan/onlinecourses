### Components of a predictor
- well defined question (What are you trying to predict and what are you trying to predict it with?)
- collect the best input data 
- start to use the machine learning algorithms 
- estimate the parameters of those algorithms
- apply the algorithm to a new data set and then finally evaluate that algorithm on that new data


### Typical sizes for the Training and Test sets
- 60% of to be training
- 20% of to be test
- 20% of to be validation



- training versustest sets

- out of sample error
- over fitting

- ROC curves

- caret package
