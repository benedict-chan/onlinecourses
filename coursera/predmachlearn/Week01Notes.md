components of a predictor
- well defined question (What are you trying to predict and what are you trying to predict it with?)
- collect the best input data 
- start to use the machine learning algorithms 
- estimate the parameters of those algorithms
- apply the algorithm to a new data set and then finally evaluate that algorithm on that new data

- When you get a new data set,
if it's large enough, you'll set 60% of
your data set
to be training, 20% of your data set to be
test, and 20% of your valid, data set to
be validation.

### Median absolute deviation

### Mean squared error

### Sensitivity, Specificity Notes 1-6, Binary Prediction
